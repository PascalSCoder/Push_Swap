# Push_Swap
A constrained sorting algorithm: Recursively solved

Goal: Sort N numbers on a stack, ascending from top (lowest) to bottom (highest), with least amount of operations

Restrictions/rules:
- There are 2 stacks available, numbers must always be in either one of these.
- Moving numbers can only be done using subject-defined operations:
1. Swap: Swap top 2 numbers of a stack
2. Rotate: Rotate all numbers on a stack by 1
3. Reverse Rotate: Rotate in reverse order
4. Push: Move a number to the other stack
